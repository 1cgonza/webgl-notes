# WebGL App
I use this little app to quickly get down to writting code. It uses the following modules:

- [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)
- [webpack-stream](https://github.com/shama/webpack-stream)
  - [shader-loader](https://github.com/Makio64/shader-loader) which works as a webpack plugin
- [browser-sync](https://github.com/browsersync/browser-sync)

You need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed.

### Installation

On the terminal, go to the folder and run: `npm install`

`gulp`
