# WebGL App
I use this little app to quickly get started. This is by no means a recommended for everyone setup or code snippets. It is just what I personally use to get started with 2D animation rendering using WebGL.

It uses the following modules:

- [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)
- [webpack-stream](https://github.com/shama/webpack-stream)
- [browser-sync](https://github.com/browsersync/browser-sync)
- Also uses babel and a couple of webpack loaders (shader-loader, and file-loader)

You need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed.

**To install:** open the terminal, go to the folder and run: `npm install`

**To run:** on the terminal use: `gulp`

Some other useful tools for developing WebGL applications:
- [Shader Editor Extension for Chrome](https://github.com/spite/ShaderEditorExtension)
- [WebGL Inspector](http://benvanik.github.io/WebGL-Inspector/)
